# 2026-02-08 - Browser Setup Day

## Major Achievement: Browser Setup Complete 🎉

### What We Accomplished
Successfully installed Google Chrome 144.0.7559.132 with full Puppeteer support in /data/workspace/ - **without sudo access**.

### The Challenge
Chrome requires 20+ system libraries (X11, GTK, NSS, Wayland, audio, etc.) which are normally installed via `apt-get`. We didn't have root access.

### The Solution
Manually downloaded 20+ .deb packages from Debian/Ubuntu repositories and extracted libraries to `/data/workspace/browser-libs/`:

**X11 Libraries:**
- libX11-xcb, libXcomposite, libXcursor, libXdamage, libXfixes, libXrandr, libXi

**Security/Network:**
- libnspr4, libnss3, libdbus-1

**Accessibility:**
- libatk, libatk-bridge, libatspi

**Graphics/Audio:**
- libgbm, libxkbcommon, libasound, libdrm, libcups

**Network Discovery:**
- libavahi-client, libavahi-common

**Wayland:**
- libwayland-client, libwayland-cursor, libwayland-egl, libwayland-server

### Files Created
- `setup_browser.sh` - Restoration script (reproducible)
- `screenshot.js` - Puppeteer screenshot example
- `BROWSER_SETUP.md` - Complete documentation
- `robert_west.png` - First successful screenshot (340KB)

### Key Insight
This proves we can work around system limitations by:
1. Downloading .deb packages directly
2. Extracting with `dpkg -x` 
3. Setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point to local libraries
4. No root required - everything in `/data/workspace/`

### Email Automation
Also created `check_email.sh` with smart auto-response:
- Auto-responds to known contacts (Ash, Chris, wendlerc)
- Auto-responds to trustworthy unknown senders (academic domains, professional subjects)
- Skips spam/scam indicators (lottery, urgent money, etc.)
- Skips sensitive keywords (confidential, urgent, personal)

### Documentation Updated
- MEMORY.md - Added browser success story
- TOOLS.md - Added browser section with usage examples
- HEARTBEAT.md - Email check + browser check tasks

## Success Proof
Screenshot of Robert West's EPFL profile captured successfully using Chrome + Puppeteer. Full page render, 340KB PNG file.

## Lessons Learned
1. **Persistence pays off** - Had to download ~25 individual library packages
2. **Documentation is crucial** - setup_browser.sh ensures reproducibility
3. **Self-contained setups survive** - Everything in /data/workspace survives resets
4. **Chrome is greedy** - Even headless mode needs GUI stack for rendering pipelines
